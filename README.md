# Transformer : Text-generation

In this lab, we learned a comprehensive set of tasks related to natural language processing and deep learning, particularly using the GPT-2 model. The key components of the learning process include:

## Installation of pytorch-transformers:
The lab began with the installation of the pytorch-transformers library. This step is crucial for leveraging pre-trained transformer-based models and working with them in a PyTorch environment.

## Loading the GPT2 Pre-trained Model:
After installing the necessary library, the individual gained hands-on experience in loading the GPT-2 pre-trained model. This process involved understanding how to access and utilize a powerful pre-trained language model for subsequent tasks.

## Fine-tuning on a Customized Dataset:
A significant part of the lab focused on fine-tuning the GPT-2 model using a customized dataset. The ability to fine-tune allows the model to adapt to specific data and tasks, enhancing its performance and making it applicable to domain-specific contexts. The individual likely learned the steps involved in preparing and training the model with their own dataset.

## Generating a New Paragraph:
The practical application of the learned concepts was demonstrated by generating a new paragraph based on a given sentence. This task showcased the model's ability to understand context and generate coherent text, illustrating the power of transformer models for natural language generation.
